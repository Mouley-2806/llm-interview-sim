# llm-interview-sim
The goal is to build an LLM-based chatbot that can simulate technical or behavioural interviews for job seekers. This tool should not only ask relevant questions based on the chosen role but also evaluate the candidateâ€™s responses, offering feedback, scoring, and suggestions for improvement.
